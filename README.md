String matching algorithms are used to find one or more patterns or sequences of patterns from massive text data or symbols. Pattern matching, or String matching, involves examining a given sequence of characters to determine if it contains elements of a particular pattern. In this process, a smaller string, called the pattern string "p," is searched for within a larger string or text string "S." The objective is to ascertain whether the pattern "p" occurs within "S" and, if so, to report the position(s) where it occurs. Pattern-matching algorithms work for many purposes in engineering and bioinformatics (a study related to genetics and genomics). They are mainly used for information retrieval, search engines, intrusion detection, data compression, content filtering, and bioinformatics to analyse DNA and other genome sequences. In this project, we aim to discuss the performance of different String-Matching Algorithms like Na√Øve String Matching, Rabin Karp Algorithm, Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm, Boyer Moore Algorithm and, in conclusion, determine the algorithm with better performance characteristics.
